# Introduction

We'll do this mostly as a demonstration. We encourage you to login to your account and try out the various examples yourself as we go through them.

Much of this material is based on the extensive Savio documention we have prepared and continue to prepare, available at [https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/).

The materials for this tutorial are available using git at the short URL ([tinyurl.com/brc-nov21](https://tinyurl.com/brc-nov21)), the  GitHub URL ([https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-python-jupyter-fall-2021](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-python-jupyter-fall-2021)), or simply as a [zip file](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-python-jupyter-fall-2021/archive/main.zip).
